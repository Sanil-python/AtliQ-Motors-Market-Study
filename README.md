Introduction:- 
AtliQ Motors, a leading automotive giant from the USA renowned for its expertise in electric vehicles (EVs), has achieved remarkable success in North America, capturing a 25% market share in the electric and hybrid vehicle segment over the past five years. 
In line with their ambitious expansion strategy, the company aims to introduce its bestselling models to the Indian market, where their current share stands at less than 2%. 
To ensure a successful market entry, Bruce Haryali, the Chief of AtliQ Motors India, has commissioned a comprehensive market study to understand the dynamics of the EV and hybrid vehicle market in India. 
This study will provide crucial insights needed to tailor their approach and capitalize on the growing opportunities in this emerging market.
